right now you’ve basically got two different tools jammed together without a narrative for the user, so it feels a bit “schizophrenic” as you said.



A landing page is the cleanest fix — it acts as a “hub” where the user understands what the dashboard is and can choose their path.



Here’s a structure that works well:

Landing Page Flow


1. 
Headline


“Text & News Intelligence Dashboard”
(Something that unites both the RSS/news and the NLP tools.)


2. 
Two Big Sections


A. Analyse Your Own Text

Sentiment Analysis

Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Summarisation

Emotion Detection

Question Answering



B. Analyse the News (ABC RSS)

Choose ABC category (Top Stories, Australia, Just In…)

Option to analyse any article using one or multiple NLP tools.

UX Flow Options


You can do this with two buttons on the landing page:



🔍 Text Analysis → goes to your current 5-page NLP dashboard.



📰 News Analysis → goes to your ABC feed page, but when a user clicks an article, you pop up a modal:



“Run Sentiment, Summarisation, or the Full Pipeline?”
Why this works
Cleaner mental model: The user knows there are two modes — text or news.

Keeps professional feel: Looks intentional, not like a random mix of features.

Adds “discovery”: The news side naturally drives engagement — people click on current events.

You can still Indiana Jones it later by styling the landing page like a map with two “paths” to choose.

Here’s a mock flow you can implement that merges your five NLP tools with the ABC RSS feed in a way that’s clean, professional, and still has room for a theme if you want it later.

Landing Page: “Text & News Intelligence Dashboard”


(Think of this as the airport terminal before they board their “analysis flight.”)

1️⃣ Top Header


Title:

Text & News Intelligence Dashboard

Subtitle:

“Choose your source — your own text or live Australian news — and run advanced NLP analysis.”

2️⃣ Two Large Cards (Mode Selector)


Card 1 — Analyse Your Own Text

Icon: ✏️ (document icon)

Description: “Paste or upload text and explore Sentiment, NER, Summarisation, Emotion, or QA individually.”

Button: Start Text Analysis →

Route: /text-analysis (leads to your current 5-page NLP dashboard)

Card 2 — Analyse Live ABC News

Icon: 📰 (newspaper icon)

Description: “Browse the latest ABC News headlines and run them through any NLP tool — or the full analysis pipeline.”

Button: Explore News →

Route: /news-analysis (leads to the ABC RSS feed view)

News Analysis Page (RSS view)
Sidebar: Category selector (Top Stories, Australia, Just In…)

Main Panel:

List of articles (headline, snippet, “Read full article” link)

Each article has an “Analyse” button → opens a modal:

Modal: “Run Analysis”

Options:

Sentiment

NER

Summarise

Emotion

QA

Run Full Pipeline (applies all five sequentially)



Run Button → /news-analysis/result?article_id=xxx&tools=selected

Text Analysis Page (Your current NLP dashboard)
Keep as-is: five tabs/pages (Sentiment, NER, Summarisation, Emotion, QA)

Optional upgrade: Add “Run Full Pipeline” button for convenience.

Landing Page
├── Text Analysis → Sentiment | NER | Summarise | Emotion | QA
└── News Analysis (ABC RSS)
├── Select Category
├── Pick Article
└── Choose Tools (single or full pipeline)

Why this flow works
It separates concerns — the user picks source first (custom text vs news).

Each “mode” feels intentional, not random.

Gives you a natural place to expand later (other news feeds, PDFs, etc.).

Still works if you later add an Indiana Jones map theme (“Pick your adventure: Your Scroll or The Daily Dispatch
