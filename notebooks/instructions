Alright — here’s a step-by-step plan to turn your current 5-page NLP dashboard into a professional-looking, live ABC News–powered NLP app with both single-tool and full-pipeline modes.

Goal
Keep your 5 NLP tools: Sentiment (default), NER, Summarise, Emotion, QA.

Add ABC News RSS integration so users can pick articles to analyse.

Give users two modes:

Run an article through a single NLP tool.

Run an article through all five in sequence (a “pipeline” mode).

Present it as a clean, modern product rather than just “a bunch of models.”

1. Data Source Integration


Feature: Fetch live headlines + summaries from ABC RSS feeds.

Use feedparser to get the latest 10–20 articles.

Store: title, link, published, summary from RSS feed.

Optional: Fetch full article text using newspaper3k when the user selects a story.



UI:

A collapsible left-hand sidebar (or top dropdown) listing article headlines + publish date.

Clicking an article loads the text into the analysis area.

2. User Mode Selection


Two top-level buttons or tabs:

Single Tool Mode — Pick one NLP tool and run it on the chosen article.

Full Pipeline Mode — Automatically run Sentiment → NER → Summarise → Emotion → QA on the same article, showing results in a stacked view.

3. Single Tool Mode


Flow:

User selects an article.

Chooses tool from dropdown: Tone Analysis, Entity Finder, Summary Generator, Emotion Profile, Knowledge Query.

Runs analysis → shows output + visualisation (where applicable).



Examples:

NER → colour-coded entities inside text display.

Summarise → adjustable slider for summary length.

Sentiment/Emotion → pie chart or bar chart with labels.

QA → text box to type a question, model answers based on article.

4. Full Pipeline Mode


Flow:

User selects an article.

App automatically:

Runs Sentiment → displays a small gauge or meter.

Runs NER → displays highlights + clickable list.

Runs Summarise → shows short “Executive Summary.”

Runs Emotion → shows emotion distribution chart.

Opens QA box → lets user ask follow-up questions without reloading the article.



UI:

Stacked sections with collapsible panels so the output doesn’t overwhelm.

Clear “Step 1, Step 2…” headings so it feels like a guided workflow.

5. Backend Design
RSS fetcher function runs every time user refreshes or clicks “Get Latest Articles.”

Article fetcher loads full text on selection (from RSS link using newspaper3k).

NLP functions: Keep your existing Hugging Face pipelines for each task but refactor so they’re callable from one place (easy to chain in pipeline mode).

Result caching — once an article is processed, store outputs so the user can switch between tools instantly.

6. Professional Look & Feel
Clean branding (e.g., InsightNLP Live).

Minimal colour palette (2 main colours + accent).

Consistent component styles (buttons, dropdowns, cards).

Icons for each NLP tool in sidebar or pipeline steps.

Responsive design so it looks good on desktop/tablet.

7. Extra Enhancements
Add download results as PDF button (great for portfolio).

Allow manual text input alongside news feed, so it’s still a general NLP toolbox.

Include a “Last Updated” timestamp for the feed so it feels live.

Store last 10 articles fetched so the app works even if ABC RSS is down.

8. Suggested Implementation Order
Integrate RSS fetching into your existing app → display headlines + summaries.

Create single tool mode first (reuse your current pages but make them selectable from one interface).

Build full pipeline mode by chaining NLP functions.

Add visual polish — charts, icons, typography.

Add download results + manual input.

This way you’ll have a portfolio piece that feels like:

A real product.

Works with live, real-world data.

Can run both individual analysis and multi-step pipelines.

If you want, I can map out the exact UI layout so the RSS feed, tool selector, and results area all fit neatly and look like a professional SaaS tool. That will make sure it’s sleek rather than cluttered.

let’s do this in a production-friendly way so your ABC News RSS integration is clean, maintainable, and ready for deployment.



I’ll assume you’re using Python on the backend (Flask/FastAPI) and your dashboard framework (like Streamlit, Dash, or a JS frontend) will call your backend API to get the news feed.

Step 1 — Install dependencies


We’ll use:

feedparser → to parse the RSS XML.

requests → to handle network requests with timeouts.

newspaper3k → to optionally fetch the full article content.

pip install feedparser requests newspaper3k

Step 2 — Backend RSS fetcher (abc_news.py)


We’ll make a reusable function with:

Configurable feed URL (so you can switch between ABC categories easily).

Timeout & error handling (important for production).

Lightweight caching to avoid hammering the ABC servers.

# abc_news.py
import feedparser
import requests
from newspaper import Article
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# ABC RSS feed URLs
ABC_FEEDS = {
"top_stories": "https://www.abc.net.au/news/feed/51120/rss.xml",
"australia": "https://www.abc.net.au/news/feed/51892/rss.xml",
"just_in": "https://www.abc.net.au/news/feed/52498/rss.xml"
}

# Simple in-memory cache
_cache_data = None
_cache_expiry = None
CACHE_TTL = timedelta(minutes=10) # refresh every 10 minutes

def get_abc_feed(feed_name="top_stories", full_text=False):
global _cache_data, _cache_expiry

# Use cache if available
if _cache_data and _cache_expiry > datetime.utcnow():
return _cache_data

# Validate feed name
feed_url = ABC_FEEDS.get(feed_name)
if not feed_url:
raise ValueError(f"Invalid feed name: {feed_name}")

try:
# Parse RSS feed
feed = feedparser.parse(feed_url)
articles = []
for entry in feed.entries:
article_data = {
"title": entry.title,
"link": entry.link,
"published": entry.get("published", ""),
"summary": entry.get("summary", "")
}

# Optional: Fetch full article text
if full_text:
try:
article = Article(entry.link)
article.download()
article.parse()
article_data["full_text"] = article.text
except Exception as e:
article_data["full_text"] = None

articles.append(article_data)

# Cache results
_cache_data = articles
_cache_expiry = datetime.utcnow() + CACHE_TTL

return articles

except requests.RequestException as e:
raise RuntimeError(f"Error fetching RSS feed: {e}")

Step 3 — Create API endpoint (FastAPI example)


Your frontend (Streamlit/Dash/React) can hit this endpoint to get fresh articles.

# main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, Query
from abc_news import get_abc_feed

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/news")
def fetch_news(feed_name: str = Query("top_stories"), full_text: bool = False):
try:
articles = get_abc_feed(feed_name=feed_name, full_text=full_text)
return {"status": "success", "count": len(articles), "articles": articles}
except Exception as e:
return {"status": "error", "message": str(e)}

# main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, Query
from abc_news import get_abc_feed

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/news")
def fetch_news(feed_name: str = Query("top_stories"), full_text: bool = False):
try:
articles = get_abc_feed(feed_name=feed_name, full_text=full_text)
return {"status": "success", "count": len(articles), "articles": articles}
except Exception as e:
return {"status": "error", "message": str(e)}

Run with:

uvicorn main:app --reload
Step 4 — Frontend Integration
Streamlit example
import streamlit as st
import requests

st.title("ABC News NLP Dashboard")

feed_choice = st.selectbox("Select feed:", ["top_stories", "australia", "just_in"])
full_text = st.checkbox("Fetch full article text")

if st.button("Get Latest Articles"):
resp = requests.get(
"http://localhost:8000/news",
params={"feed_name": feed_choice, "full_text": full_text}
)
data = resp.json()
if data["status"] == "success":
for article in data["articles"]:
st.subheader(article["title"])
st.write(article["published"])
st.write(article["summary"])
if full_text and article.get("full_text"):
st.write(article["full_text"][:500] + "...")
else:
st.error(data["message"])
Why this is “Best Practice”
Configurable feed list — easy to add more categories later.

Timeouts & exceptions — protects against app hanging on bad connections.

Lightweight caching — reduces API calls and speeds up dashboard.

Full-text option — only scrape heavy content when the user needs it.

Backend-first approach — keeps RSS fetching logic separate from UI.

We can now extend this plan to run the fetched article directly through your five NLP tools
or the pipeline, so the moment a user clicks an ABC headline, they get instant analysis. 
That would unify the feed and NLP into one smooth workflow - this is an optional thing we might implement
